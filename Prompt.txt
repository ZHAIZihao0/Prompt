There is a html format table, identify the relationships between each data cell and its related row header and column header. Independently output each data cell along with its related headers and its location in the table as json format. In the JSON file, divide the headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "1-level row_header": "Laboratory data","2-level row_header": "eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2)"
