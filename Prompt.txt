There is a html format table. Independently output each data cell, its location, row header and column header as JSON format. Each of these values should followed by a confidence level high, medium or low to present your assessment of the correctness of this result. When it has multiple headers, divide the headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "1-level row header", "2-level row header". Otherwise just output as "row header". The attached file is an example of output.
