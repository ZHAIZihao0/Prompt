There is a html format table, identify the relationships between each data cell and its related row header and column header. Independently output each data cell along with its related headers and its location in the table as json format. If it has multiple headers, then divide the row and column headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "1-level row header", "2-level row header". Output the data and location first. If there is only 1 level header, then present it as "row header". Otherwise, present the row and column headers as the format"1-level row header".
