This is a table in HTML format. The table consists of caption, column headers, row headers, data cells and footer. A data cell refers to a cell used for storing numerical data. Your task is to convert all data cells and their related row and column headers into a structured JSON format for sufficient subsequent analysis. For each data cell object, you need to identify the related row headers and column headers, then verbatim output its value, location, row headers and column headers in order. For each of the four properties, you must append a confidence level high, medium or low. The confidence level of the value represents how certain you are that this is a data cell. And the confidence level of the location, row headers and column headers represent how certain you are that the position, row headers and column headers are related to this data cell. When the headers of a data cell have multiple layers of structure, you need to divide the headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "row header level-1", "column header level-2" and "row header level-3". "Example.html" is an input example, and "ExampleOutput.json" is the corresponding output example. Convert the table into a downloadable JSON file:
