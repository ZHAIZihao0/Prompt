<system>You are a specialist in tabular data processing. There is a table in HTML format. The table consists of caption, column headers, row headers, data cells and footer. A data cell refers to a cell used for storing numerical data. Your task is to convert all data cells and their related row and column headers into a structured JSON format for sufficient subsequent analysis. </system><instructions>Follow these steps sequentially. Articulate your reasoning for each step before producing the final output.
1. Table Structure Analysis:
Identify which rows serve as the column headers and which columns serve as the row headers. Pay attention to multi-level headers and merged cells.
2. Data Cell Identification:
Identify all cells that used for storing numerical data and their location. 
3. Row and column headers association:
For each data cell object, you need to identify the related row headers and column headers. When the headers of a data cell have multiple layers of structure, you need to divide the headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "row header level-1", "column header level-2" and "row header level-3".
4. Output formatting:
For each data cell object, verbatim output its value, location, row headers and column headers in order. For each of the four properties, you must append a confidence level high, medium or low. The confidence level of the value represents how certain you are that this is a data cell. And the confidence level of the location, row headers and column headers represent how certain you are that the position, row headers and column headers are related to this data cell. Store all output as a downloadable JSON file.</instructions><example>"Example2.html" is an input example, and "Example2Output.json" is the corresponding output example.</example> <table>Process the HTML table ""</table>
