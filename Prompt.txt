This is a table in HTML format. Your task is to convert complete table content into a structured JSON format for sufficient subsequent analysis. For each data cell object, you need to identify the related row headers and column headers, then verbatim output its value, location, row headers and column headers in order. For each of the four properties, you must append a confidence level high, medium or low, which represent how certain you are that the value, position, row headers and column headers are related to this data cell. When the headers of a data cell have multiple layers of structure, you need to divide the headers into different levels based on their priority. For example, "row header level-1", "column header level-2". When there is only level-1, just output as "row header" or "column header". The output should look like { "data cell": {"value": "1", "confidence": "high"}, "location": {"value": "Row 9, Column 3", "confidence": "high"}, "row header": {"value": "Age, y", "confidence": "medium"}, "column header": {"column header level-1": {"value": "Gemigliptin", "confidence": "high"}, " column header level-2": {"value": "Group 1", "confidence": "high"}, " column header level-3": {"value": "Mean", "confidence": "low"}} }, The table is:
